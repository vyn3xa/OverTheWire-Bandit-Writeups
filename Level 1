## Level 0 ➔ Level 1

**Goal:** Establish the initial SSH connection to the server and find the first level password.

**Solution Steps:** 1. **Accessing the Server:** Upon logging into the server, we automatically start in the **home directory**.
   
2. **Investigation:** I used the `ls` command to see which files are located here. The output shows that only the `readme` file exists.

3. **Retrieving the Password:** To reveal the hidden password inside the file, we run the following command:
   ```bash
   cat readme
